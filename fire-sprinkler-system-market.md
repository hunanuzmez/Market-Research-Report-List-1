<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fire Sprinkler System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wet Pipe Systems</li><li>Dry Pipe Systems</li><li>Deluge Systems</li><li>Pre-Action Systems</li><li>Foam Water Sprinkler Systems</li><li>Water Spray Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fire sprinkler systems can be categorized into several types based on their operational mechanisms. Wet pipe systems contain water under pressure, activating when a fire causes a sprinkler head to open. Dry pipe systems, in contrast, contain pressurized air, releasing water only after a valve opens due to heat. Deluge systems discharge large volumes of water through open heads, while pre-action systems require two triggers to activate. Foam water sprinkler systems use a foam solution for flammable liquids, and water spray systems provide directed water streams for specific hazards.</p></p>
