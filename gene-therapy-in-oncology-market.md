<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy in Oncology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy in oncology focuses on treating cancer by modifying genes to combat tumor growth. The market is categorized into two main types: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo therapy involves extracting cells from a patient, genetically modifying them in a laboratory, and then reinfusing the modified cells back into the patient. In vivo therapy, on the other hand, directly delivers genetic material into a patient's body, targeting tumor cells without the need for cell extraction. Both approaches aim to enhance cancer treatment efficacy.</p></p>
