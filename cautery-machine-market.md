<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cautery Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unipolar Device</li><li>Bipolar Device</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cautery machine market is primarily divided into two main types: unipolar and bipolar devices. Unipolar devices use a single electrode to deliver current through the patientâ€™s tissue to a grounding pad, allowing for effective cutting and coagulation during surgeries. In contrast, bipolar devices utilize two electrodes, delivering current directly between them, which minimizes collateral damage and is ideal for delicate procedures. Both types are essential in surgical settings, enhancing precision and control in tissue manipulation and hemostasis.</p></p>
